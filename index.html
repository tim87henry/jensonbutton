        Jenson Button is my favorite Formula 1 driver(apart from Schumacher). It's such a pity that he never drove for Ferrari.
        He started out with F1 in 2000 with the Williams F1 team. He tested for them and was appointed in 1999, at the age of 19. The more experienced Ralf Schumacher was his first team mate.
        He qualified a low 21st for his very first race, the 2000 Australian Grand Prix. But he showed fantastic race craft to rise up to 6th place in the race. But unfortunately, an engine failure put him out of the race.
        He scored his first points in the Brazilian Grand Prix that year, when he finished 5th. He steadily improved throughout the year. Though he was generally out performed by his team mate Ralf, he did show glimses of his talent when he out qualified him in Belgium and Japan.
        He qualified a brilliant 3rd at the Spa-Francochamps, a drivers circuit. Contact with Jarno Trulli early in the race, disrupted his chances of a podium.


        Jenson was loaned out to the Bennetton F1 team for the 2001 and 2002 seasons, where he partnered Giancarlo Fisichella. Jenson had a trully dismal season in 2001 and was well off the pace. To make matters worse, he did not get along well with team boss Flavio Briatore.
        His teammate for 2002 was another Italian, Jarno Trulli. Jenson out performed Trulli, for much of the season. He almost got his first ever podium at 

       Jenson found himself out of contract before the end of the season and was picked up by BAR F1, to replace Olivier Panis.
        2003 was Jenson's breakout year, and he consistently out qualified and out raced the more expirienced Jacques Villenueve.

        BAR made a huge step forward in 2004, and Jenson delivered his best season that year. He finished the season with 10 podiums and multiple points finishes.
